# WebDevKata2021
<br>
Thanks for spending some time with us here at Squirrels. We take great care and pride in how we select our development staff. The goal of this exercise is not to test your actual technical skills. It is a chance to work along side you. It gives you a chance to get a preview of our team and our team a preview of you.
<br><br>
[Here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/6cad374a-8081-4d1b-40cd-34968800fe77-1a9c/specs/) we have a adobe XD design presented as a feature. the XD document should have most of what you need (color pallet and such).
<br><br>
This is almost a fresh project. One of the other developers has completed the API / weather integration of the project and took the liberty to set up a fresh Vue.js application with the basic state store. The dev didn't do everything, but feels they did enough to get you rolling and give you a example of our style. 
<br><br>
Were going to focus on the first two tabs (Today and Hourly).<br>
For the today tab the dev went ahead and built out the state store and the API call. The hourly tab has the endpoint in the api, but you will need to handle getting that data when you get there.
